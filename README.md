# Using PlantCV for the Shakoor Lab Sorghum/Fonio Lines

This is a code repository for different Image Analysis techniques of our NS_001-NS_009 trials using Donald Danforth's in house created software, called PlantCV. PlantCV is an open-source image analysis software package, specifically for plant science. The Shakoor Lab uses PlantCV to measure plant traits (aka phenotypes) from images. You can find more information about PlantCV here: https://plantcv.org/

# Image Analysis

The images that we analyze, are obtained through using the Bellwhether Phenotyper that is located here at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. The Bellwether Foundation Phenotyping Facility is an integrated growth chamber and imaging facility.

The Bellwether Facility provides high capacity, high-throughput phenotyping in a controlled environment to characterize how plants respond to different environments, treatments, and genetics. Results include information related to plant growth, plant development, and plant stress responses.
